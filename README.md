# Modified-MMF-Morgan-Morgan-Finney-model
These python codes automate the process to estimate runoff, soil loss, and sedimentation yield using the Modified MMF (Morgan–Morgan–Finney) model, which was originally developed for evaluating effects of crops and vegetation cover on soil erosion. These codes have been used and are a part of the following research paper: "Application of GIS-Coupled Modified MMF Model to Estimate Sediment Yield on a Watershed Scale", https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001063.
Users must read the paper before using these codes for their area of resarch/study.
